#For loop
#default 1(inc,dec)
#syntax:
#      for i in range(start,end):
          #statement

#in for the starting is at 1 and ending is at end-1
#eg: to print hello 10 times we set the range from (1 to 11) or (0 to 10)
# for i in range(1,11):
#     print('Hello')

#for i in range(10)....in this case 10 is read as end, so it print from 0 to 9 times

#normal syntax:
#        for i in range(start,end,inc/dec)
#eg:
# for i in range(3,31,3):
#     print(i)......3,6,9,12,....30
